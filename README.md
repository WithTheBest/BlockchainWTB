# Speakers
  - Muneeb Ali at [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org) :
Talk: An introduction to Blockchains
"Get introduced to blockchains, how Bitcoin (the most secure blockchain) works, and discover what new types of applications and services are enabled by blockchains. Explore what is a Bitcoin miner, what is a 51% attack, how to sign transactions, what are unspent outputs. Further, learn about limitations of blockchains (limited storage, slow write times) and solutions to these limitations."

  - Mano Thanabalan at [Otonomos](https://otonomos.com/) :
Talk: A Concept Proposal for an Ethereum, IPFS and JVM powered dApp
"The Solidity programming language was built to address the non-deterministic way in which traditional languages such as Java compile into byte or machine specific code. The need for deterministic compilation to assembly language stems from deterministically calculating the running cost of a given Smart Contract. However, if the code, compiled byte code and variable state storage could be stored in a file in IPFS after being run and verified in a JVM, then deterministic compilation would no longer be a relevant requirement. Besides the obvious reduction in gas consumption, this design will also circumvent the Smart Contract gas limit and more complex smart contracts could be deployed."

  - Josh Cincinnati at [BlockCypher](http://www.blockcypher.com/) :
Talk: Blockchains and APIs: The Decentralization Spectrum
"One of the primary features of a blockchain is its decentralization guarantees, but decentralization is not a binary decision. BlockCypher's developer advocate will dive into the tradeoffs between running your own blockchain infrastructure and using a third-party API, using examples and use-cases from BlockCypher's APIs and customers."
